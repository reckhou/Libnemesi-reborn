/*!
 * \brief Session informations
 *
 * Each field will point to a description string inside the body of the
 * description arrived from server.
 *
 * On efficency, the same is true for the informations about medium, we can
 * analyse the strategy used for savig the fields.  In detail, the \b body of
 * the SDP description is entirely saved in memory and, then, \em tokenized
 * line by line. This way, the memory location is divided into strings, each
 * containing an information field.
 * Now it's possible to scan the entire memory location, whose size is known,
 * and to assign each pointer field to the right description string. If an
 * information is not present the corresponding pointer is left to the
 * initialization value: \c NULL. Using this strategy we have a slight waste of
 * memory space, but this is certainly lower than using pre-allocated strings.
 * Furthermore we avoid many \c malloc in the code that would make heavier the
 * execution of the program.
